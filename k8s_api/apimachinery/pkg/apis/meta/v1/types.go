// Package v1 contains API types that are common to all versions.
//
// The package contains two categories of types:
// - external (serialized) types that lack their own version (e.g TypeMeta)
// - internal (never-serialized) types that are needed by several different
//   api groups, and so live here, to avoid duplication and/or import loops
//   (e.g. LabelSelector).
// In the future, we will probably move these categories of objects into
// separate packages.
package v1

// TypeMeta describes an individual object in an API response or request
// with strings representing the type of the object and its API schema version.
// Structures that are versioned or persisted should inline TypeMeta.
type TypeMeta struct {
	// Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents.
	// Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to.
	// Cannot be updated.
	// In CamelCase.
	// More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
	Kind string `json:"kind,omitempty"`

	// APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
	// Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
	// may reject unrecognized values.

	APIVersion string `json:"apiVersion,omitempty"`

// ListMeta describes metadata that synthetic resources must have, including lists and
// various status objects. A resource may have only one of {ObjectMeta, ListMeta}.
type ListMeta struct {
	// String that identifies the server's internal version of this object that
	// can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed.

	// the server has more data available. The value is opaque and may be used to issue another request
	// to the endpoint that served this list to retrieve the next set of available objects. Continuing a
	// consistent list may not be possible if the server configuration has changed or more than a few
	// minutes have passed. The resourceVersion field returned when using this continue value will be
	// identical to the value in the first response, unless you have received this token from an error
	// message.

	// list response. If the list request contained label or field selectors, then the number of
	// remaining items is unknown and the field will be left unset and omitted during serialization.
	// If the list is complete (either because it is not chunking or because this is the last chunk),
	// then there are no more remaining items and this field will be left unset and omitted during
	// serialization.
